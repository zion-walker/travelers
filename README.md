In this study, some mascots are encountered doing new actions in different locations each trial (ex. waving in classroom vs. running on a baseball field vs. watching fireworks) whereas other mascots videos are very similar across trials (ex. doing different actions in the same shopping mall)

*are mascots that travel often more memorable than others?*

This sub-analysis aims to address whether memory retrieval is influenced by the uniqueness of episodic events. 

### Overarching Study Description: What is seqlearn?  
The present study lead by Dr. Halle Dimsdale-Zucker aims to test whether statistical structure imposed at encoding and reinstated at retrieval can serve as a context to guide memory. We hypothesize that statistical structure facilitates learning, and maintaining statistical regularities at retrieval improves memory performance.

I will be determining the memorability of specific mascot videos by comparing the rates of correctly identifying studied videos as ‚Äúold‚Äù vs. incorrectly judging unstudied videos as ‚Äúold‚Äù across participants.

1. import necessary packages (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
2. Load/Read Datafile
3. Clean Dataset
4. In Cleaned Dataset, Isolate columns relevant to Recognition Phase
```
["phase_id", "mascot_name", "video_context", "Response", 'stim_type']
```
5. Isolate all responses where "phase_id" is equal to "recog_random" and "recog_ordered"
6. Determine whether response is a Hit or Other Response
7. when studied and sure/maybe/guess old, = Hit
8. Create a Boolean mask in a new column True = Hit
```
np.where((recog_test_data['stim_type'] == 'studied') & 
((recog_test_data['Response'] == 'sure old') | (recog_test_data['Response'] == 
'maybe old') | (recog_test_data['Response'] == 'guess old')), True, False)

```
9. Rename items in Boolean Column so that TRUE = Hit,
10. False = Miss, Incorrect rejection, Correct rejection, False Alarm
11. Determine the total number of responses for each video in a new column** 
```
hit['resp_type_total'] = hit.groupby('video_context')['response_count'].transform('sum')
```
12. Calculate the ‚ÄúHit Rate‚Äù per mascot video in a new column
13. divide total Hit across participants by total number of responses
14. Create a DataFrame indexed by Mascot Video with Hit Rate as column
15. Visualize this data in a bar graph

## Creating a Linear Mixed Effect Model <img alt="R" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/r-%23276DC3.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=r&logoColor=white"/>
Linear Mixed Effect Models (LMEM) aim to determine the extent to which data values are influenced by different factors, or 'fixed effects'. In this case we are investigating the following:
 
 _To what extent is 'hit rate' determined by whether the video is viewed during the ordered vs. random condition?_
 
 _To what extent is the 'hit rate', or memorability of each video determined by the mascot in the video?_
